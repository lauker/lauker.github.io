Dvex,Didemnum,vexillum,"A colonial tunicate consists of many zooids, bearing most or all of the organs of a solitary tunicate, but modified to varying degrees for colonial life. Colonial tunicates of the family Didemnidae have small zooids, completely embedded in an encrusting and thin tunic. Each zooid has an oral siphon and an atrial aperture which opens to a shared cloacal chamber. Water is pumped into the oral siphon, through finely meshed ciliated gills on the pharynx, where phytoplankton and detritus is filtered, and passed on mucus strings to the stomach and intestines. Excess waste is expelled in the outgoing atrial water (Van Name 1945; Barnes 1983).",https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/103528429,Nonindigenous
Bvio,Botrylloides,violaceous,"Botrylloides violaceus is a colonial tunicate that can vary in color, ranging from purple, light lavender, red, yellow, orange and brown. In all cases the colony is entirely one color. Botrylloides violaceus colonies are encrusting, usually 2 Ð 3 mm in thickness (Saito et al. 1981) and can be large, up to 200 mm x 20 mm. ÊThe tunic is soft, easily torn and the zooids are easily freed from the tunic (Lambert 2003). Zooids are arranged in ladder-like chains, with several common cloacal openings. Between chains of zooids the tunic surface is sometimes elevated. Zooids have 10-11 rows of stigmata and 9-12 stomach folds. Ova (reproductive cells) are located dorsal-posterior to testis, consisting of up to 16 follicles. The larvae of B. violaceus are incubated in the tunic. They are nourished by the tunic vascular system and continue to grow even after the adult zooid dies. The larvae are particularly large (up to 3 mm in length) with 24-32 lateral ampullae (Saito et al. 1981; Nishikawa 1991; Lambert 2003). Fully developed larvae are released from the incubatory pouch via the common cloacal openings (Saito et al. 1981).",https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Botrylloides_violaceus_%28cropped%29.jpg,Nonindigenous
Aasp,Ascidiella,aspersa,"Ascidiella aspersa is a solitary tunicate. It is oval-shaped, wider near the base and narrower at the top where the two siphons protrude, the oral siphon extends off the top and the atrial siphon extends off the side about a third of the way down the body. It grows up to 130 mm long and is usually attached on the posterior left side. The siphons are short and conical (cone-shaped) and ridged with 8-10 branchial lobes and six atrial lobes. Papillae are scattered over the body surface, especially on the right side and near the apertures. The test (outer covering) is firm but thin, rough and gristly, gray, black or brownish in color, and often with attached debris (Kott 1985, MarLin 2006).",https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/173438566,Nonindigenous
Scla,Styela,clava,"Styela clava is a solitary tunicate with a leathery, but thin, and bumpy tunic. Its body is cylindrical or club-shaped and narrows posteriorly to a stalk that is anchored to the substrata by a disk shaped holdfast. The wrinkled or creased looking stalk is often 20-50% of the total body length. Styela clava can grow up to 150 mm in length. Colors can range from yellowish to reddish to brownish. The oral and atrial siphons are located close together and are directed anteriorly. Both siphons have four lobes and appear striped with alternating dark and light brownish to purplish bands (Kott 1985; Nishikawa 1991; Lambert 2003).",https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/211068609,Nonindigenous
